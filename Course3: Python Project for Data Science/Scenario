For this project, I will assume the role of a Data Analyst working for
a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks.
My job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly
revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping popular stocks.
After collecting this data I will visualise it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends.
The stocks I will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD and GameStop.
