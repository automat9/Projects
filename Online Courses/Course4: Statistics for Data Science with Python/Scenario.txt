I am a Data Scientist with a housing agency in Boston MA, I have been given access to a previous dataset on housing prices
derived from the U.S. Census Service to present insights to higher management. Based on my experience in Statistics, what 
information can I provide them to help with making an informed decision? Upper management will like to get some insight into
the following.

1) Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles river or not?

2) Is there a difference in median values of houses of each proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?

3) Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail 
business acres per town?

4) What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centres on the median value of
owner-occupied homes?

Using the appropriate graphs and charts, I need to generate basic statistics and visualizations that I think will be useful 
for the upper management to give them important insight given the question they are asking, in my graphs, I will include
an explanation of each statistic.
