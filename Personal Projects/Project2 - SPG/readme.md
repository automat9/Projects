Secure Pass Generator (SPG) generates secure 20-character random strings and creates a .txt file to store all your generated passwords together with logins.

1. Assign a name to your password (e.g., Facebook, Laptop).

2. Enter login details if applicable; otherwise, specify "n/a".

3. Click "Generate and Add Entry".

4. Repeat as needed for additional passwords.

5. Click "Save Entries" to generate a .txt file with all your data. The file will appear on your desktop.

Note: Windows may flag Secure Pass Generator.exe as a security risk. However, the program is safe. You can ignore the warning or scan the file with your antivirus software. If you prefer, you can also run the code yourself by copying it from "Code.py" into your IDE.
