For this project, I created an interactive dashboard consisting of five graphs (see 'Visualisations' folder).

The development process was as follows:
1. I found an open-source dataset and extracted columns that suited my assignment scenario
2. Next, I preprocessed the data to prepare it for visualisation. This involved grouping, filtering, merging, and calculating new metrics such as the probability of late delivery.
3. I then defined the layout and structure of the Dash app, making sure they were clearly presented and easy to understand.

Lastly, I wrote a detailed and well-structured report that explained the reasoning behind each decision made in the dashboard, ultimately receiving a mark of 73 for the project.
